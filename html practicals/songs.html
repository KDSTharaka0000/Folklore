<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i>the 1 </i></h3>

<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
"the 1,” the second single from the album, centers around the nostalgic remembrance of myths and lost loves. Taylor contemplates an alternate life in which her old wishes had “come true” and resulted in a relationship with an ex-lover.

Sharing a similar sentiment to Swift’s track “I Almost Do” from October 2012’s Red, “the 1” is a callback to the folk moments from the same record, folk music being a defining influence on folklore.

</p>

<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> cardigan </i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);">
Accompanied by the release of her project written and recorded during the lockdown due to COVID-19, “cardigan” is the lead single from Taylor Swift’s eighth studio album, folklore.
“cardigan” is believed to be the first part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of Betty. The storyline is followed by “august” and “betty.” 

</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-cardigan-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>

<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> the last great american dynasty</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
“the last great american dynasty” follows the story of Rebekah Harkness, a patron of the arts, and founder of the Rebekah Harkness Foundation.

In 2013, Swift bought a Rhode Island mansion once owned by Rebekah Harkness. The mansion is known as “Holiday House.”

Taylor draws subtle comparisons between herself and Rebekah Harkness in the song. She likens her star-studded parties to the bevy of famous composers and and dancers that once frequented Holiday house in Harkness' days. Also similar to Taylor Swift, Rebekah Harkness was often a target of harsh criticism from the tabloids, and people alike.
The style of the song follows Taylor Swift’s familiar contemporary pop sound. She spends most of the song singing in a low octave, transitioning to a higher octave only towards the end of the song. The song has elements of folk music in it too, matching the overall theme of the album.
</p>
<a class="nav" href ="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-last-great-american-dynasty-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>

<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> exile(Ft.Bon Iver)</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
“exile” describes two ex-lovers seeing each other following a break-up. Justin Vernon describes feelings of confusion about how quickly a lover moved on, while Swift offers a perspective about repeated warning signs that the relationship was no longer working. It’s also worth noting the contrast between Vernon’s rougher voice and Swift’s smoother one, which mirrors the contrast between their views of the relationship.
<br><br>
The song prompted many comparisons to Swift’s 2012 track “The Last Time,” another song that discusses the downfall of a relationship. Much like “exile,” Swift and featured artist Gary Lightbody’s voices contrast in tone, highlighting their differences.
<br><br>
“exile” is one of many folklore songs to contain a movie motif — other songs to do so include “the 1,” “this is me trying,” and “hoax.” It’s also her first collaboration with Bon Iver, who she called one of her “musical heroes” in an Instagram post announcing folklore.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> the my tear ricochet</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
“my tears ricochet” is about an “embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession.” She revealed in a YouTube livechat that it was the first song she wrote for folklore.
<br><br>
Some fans believe it connects to Swift’s personal life as well — with the song really being about Scott Borchetta’s betrayal of Swift when she left Big Machine records for Republic.
<br><br>
In addition, on August 2017’s “Look What You Made Me Do,” Swift infamously proclaimed “the old Taylor” dead. The prominent funeral imagery makes it sound like Swift may be mourning this metaphorical murder.

</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-my-tears-ricochet-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>

<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> mirrorball</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
On “mirrorball,” the sixth track off of Taylor Swift’s surprise eighth studio album, folklore, she compares herself to a reflective disco ball: she sees herself as reflecting all the personalities around her, she entertains others, and she shatters like glass when her heart is broken.
</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-mirrorball-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>

<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> seven</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
This song is about one of Taylor’s childhood friends who seemed to have had an unhappy life at home. Taylor reflects back on her innocence back then, how she thought that their problems could be easily solved.
<br><br>
This is reminiscent of the song “It’s Nice to Have A Friend”, from August 2019’s Lover album, which talks about a childhood friend that Taylor grows up with and eventually marries.
<br><br>
On August 20, 2020, Taylor included “seven” on the folklore: the escapism chapter EP, indicating that it fits thematically with folklore’s other songs about seeking relief from unpleasantness.
</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-seven-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>


<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> august</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
“august” is another folklore track produced with Swift’s frequent collaborator and friend Jack Antonoff, who called the song one of his “favorite things [they’ve] done together.”
<br><br>
The song describes an ill-fated summer romance, similarly to Swift’s earlier works like 2006’s “Tim McGraw.” Fans believe it’s the second part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of the girl James cheated on Betty with. The storyline is preceded by “cardigan” and followed by “betty.”
<br><br>
In the folklore album prologue, Swift says the album is inspired by “the sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine.” It’s also worth noting that August is the eighth month of the year, and “august” is the eighth track on folklore—and folklore is Swift’s eighth album that has eight deluxe versions.
</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-august-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>

<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> this is me trying</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
Much like Swift’s August 2019 track “Afterglow,” “this is me trying” sees her accepting fault for relationship issues and making an effort to repair them. Fear, alcohol, and a sense of failure and isolation complicate the healing process, but she takes the first step by having the humility to admit things are difficult and uncertain.
<br><br>
October 2014’s “I Wish You Would,” another collaboration with Jack Antonoff, offers a similar narrative with parallels in imagery and language (driving cars, flashbacks, anger, and regrets), but here she is more proactively taking risks and putting herself out there, even though she still doesn’t have the perfect solution.
</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-this-is-me-trying-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>



<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> illicit affairs</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
“illicit affairs” tackles the idea of infidelity, which she first discussed on 2006’s “Should’ve Said No.” In the decade since she released “Should’ve Said No,” Swift’s conception of infidelity has changed from one of blanket condemnation to a significantly more nuanced and sympathetic take recognizing both “the dwindling, mercurial high” that infidelity can bring but also the heartbreak that it inevitably results in.
</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-illicit-affairs-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>


<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> invisible string</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
“invisible string” references an east Asian folk myth about a red thread of fate tying two soulmates together. Like on Swift’s 2019 track “Lover,” she expresses gratitude for past romantic failures since they paved the way for her relationship with Joe Alwyn.
<br>
The song includes several nods to Swift’s past work, including October 2014’s “Bad Blood” and November 2017’s “Delicate.” Like on October 2012’s “Red” and August 2019’s “Daylight,” she uses the connotations of different colors to convey the intensity of her love for a partner.
</p>

<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-invisible-string-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>


<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> mad woman</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
Much like her previous songs “Blank Space” and “Look What You Made Me Do,” which she references throughout the song, Swift connects the concept of a delusional woman to her personal life, particularly her battles with Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta over owning her music and rapper Kanye West after he defamed her on his song “Famous.”
<br>
Some of the story may originate from Rebekah Harkness, who Swift based earlier folklore track “the last great american dynasty” on.
</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-mad-woman-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>


<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> epiphany</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
“epiphany” describes someone hoping to find peace in their dreams despite living in a world of chaos and violence, specifically in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic. In the folklore album prologue, Swift explains that the song touches on her grandfather’s experience in the military.
</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-epiphany-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>


<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> betty</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
“betty” touches on the aftermath of “august,” which describes a summer love that was doomed from the start. Listeners learn that while the summer affair was going on, the speaker, James, was still dating their classmate, Betty.
<br><br>

The song takes a more feminist approach, portraying the narrator as a person named James who can’t own up to their mistakes, all while Betty flourishes on her own and recognizes her worth.
<br><br>
Sonically, the song exudes a strong sense of nostalgia, delivering production and instrumentals reminiscent to Taylor’s earlier projects like Fearless and Speak Now, both of which were records written by Taylor in her similarly naïve adolescence.
<br><br>
“betty” is believed to be the third part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of James. The storyline is preceded by “cardigan” and “august.”
</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-betty-lyrics"> Lyrics </a>


<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> peace</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
“peace” is a calm tune describing Swift’s maturation and changing view of romance. Like August 2019’s “The Archer,” Swift explains her shortcomings in a relationship and hopes that her partner will stay with her in spite of them. However, unlike her own personal flaws explored in “The Archer,” this song focuses on Swift’s fame — she worries that their lack of privacy could drive her partner away.
</p>
<a class="nav" href="https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-peace-lyrics'"> Lyrics </a>

<h3 style="font-size:38px;text-align:center"> <i> hoax</i></h3>
<p id="p1" style="background-color:rgb(240,240,240);"> 
An appropriate final track to an album filled with melancholy and darkness, “hoax” narrates the struggles Taylor endures in a toxic relationship. Although she has been driven to the edge of hopelessness by her lover, Taylor is unable to let go of her doomed relationship.
<br><br>
According to an interview with co-writer Aaron Dessner, “hoax” and “the 1” were the final songs written after the rest of the album was completed, and the two agreed that they should be added to the record as “bookends”. Musically, the song shares some similarities to “cardigan,” the second track of folklore.
